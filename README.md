### fun facts about me

- in 2025, I’m all about shipping fast.
- also, I’m all about authenticity.
- won several international hackathons
- you could say I’m a tech evangelist.
- fast code > clever code. (but why not both?)
- I have a beautiful wife, btw.
- my tech stack constantly shifts; I’m full-stack, so I f*cking adapt.
