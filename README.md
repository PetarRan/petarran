Just a guy trying to write performant code, optimize everything, and avoid O(n²) solutions in production. Big fan of low-latency UIs, scalable systems, and tools that don’t suck.

Fun Facts
- Everything in my repos was probably over-engineered at some point.
- Time complexity matters. Yes, even in frontend.
- Fast code > Clever code. But why not both?
- I have a beautiful wife, btw.
- I make things in React, Java, SQL, and whatever else keeps the GC happy.
- Some Strong Opinions
  - VIM is elite. But I still use VS Code because productivity > purism.
  - React is great. Until you need to optimize renders.
- Maybe I’ll make YouTubes. Maybe not. Schrödinger’s content.
